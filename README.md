## Implementation Details: <br/>
It uses react-redux to create a store, which is then updated by the input boxes.<br/><br/>
After 5 letters are stored, and the user clicks enter, it checks with a dictionary API to make sure that the input is a word, then changes the colours on the page according to wordle's rules.
